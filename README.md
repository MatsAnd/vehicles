A prototype of certification of vehicles for the
transportation of dangerous materials (ADR).

The prototype is purely frontend (HTML, clientside JS),
but in order to run it, it's helpful to have a server,
which is why it includes a very simple ExpressJS server.

Prerequisites:
--------------
* NodeJS (http://www.nodejs.org)
* (Of course) A git client
